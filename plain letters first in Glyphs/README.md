## plain letters first in Glyphs

Use this with [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) in order to keep A–Z and a–z in one row, before the accented letters, if you dislike the default sorting, which keeps plain letters and composites grouped together.

To install in Glyphs,

• press Cmd+Shift+Y in Glyphs, which opens a Finder window

• place the `GlyphData.xml` file into the `Info` subfolder (create the `Info` folder first in case it does not exist)

If you already have your own `GlyphData.xml` in this folder then you need to merge the files manually.

Note: By using this GlyphData.xml file, you may miss out on updates to the default glyph data for the plain letters, such as changes to the default anchors.
